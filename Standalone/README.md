# Auth0 Angular SDK sample

This sample app demonstrates the integration of the [Auth0 Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) into an Angular application created using the Angular CLI. This sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Angular SDK Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular).

This sample demonstrates the following use cases:

- Login
- Log out
- Showing the user profile
- Protecting routes using the authentication guard
- Calling APIs with automatically-attached bearer tokens

## Configuration

The sample needs to be configured with your Auth0 domain and client ID in order to work. In the root of the sample, copy `auth_config.json.example` and rename it to `auth_config.json`. Open the file and replace the values with those from your Auth0 tenant:

```json
{
  "domain": "<YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN>",
  "clientId": "<YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID>",
  "audience": "<YOUR AUTH0 API AUDIENCE IDENTIFIER>"
}
```

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This will automatically start a Node + Express server as the backend on port `3001`. The Angular application is configured to proxy through to this on any `/api` route.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/login-demo` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

To build and run a production bundle and serve it, run `npm run prod`. The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Run Using Docker

You can build and run the sample in a Docker container by using the provided scripts:

```bash
# In Linux / MacOS
sh exec.sh

# Windows Powershell
./exec.ps1
```

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

We are compiling a list of questions and answers regarding the new JavaScript SDK - if you're having issues running the sample applications, [check the FAQ](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js/blob/master/FAQ.md)!

# What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db/create-db-connection)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
